Accepted types
==

Note that this library will accept any primitive type, but does not accept "complex"
integers. All numeric constants and variables are converted to float64 for evaluation,
and complex64 / complex128 can't reasonably be cast to float64.

Let me know if you have complex types and need to evaluate on them.
